What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","  >> Python is a programming language ,it is popular because it is easy to understand , write and compatible with various programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming and also it has a  has a large and active community of developers, an extensive standard library.\n","  \n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","  >> An interinterpreter in python executes code line by line ,convert it machine readable . As its execute line by line its easy debug.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","  >> Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). Examples of keywords include if, else, while, for, def, class, import, try, except, return, True, False, None, etc.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","  >> No, Keywords are case-sensitive and cannot be redefined or overridden within a Python program.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","  >> Mutability refers to the objects that can be modified after creation .\n","  List and dictionaries are example for mutable object.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","  >>List can be modified after creation makes it mutable while tuples cannot be modified makes it immutable.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between '==' and 'is' operators in Python?\n","  >> '==' use for value equality, and 'is' operators is used for object identity.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","  >> Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. And, or, not are some example for logical operators.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","  >> Type casting is the process of changing one data type to another in Python.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  >> Implicit casting is performed automatically by Python and Explicit casting is done manually using functions like int(), float(), str().\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","  >> conditional statements are used to control the flow of execution.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","  >> The elif statement checks multiple conditions sequentially. It executes the first condition that evaluates to True.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","  >> \"for” loops are used for iterating over a sequence of elements, while “while” loops are used for executing code until a specified condition becomes False\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","  >> A while loop is better when the number of iterations is not fixed, such as reading user input until they type 'exit'.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"p5gnuafUDMeV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"_CtPIwslSud_"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
